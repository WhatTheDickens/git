# Git and GitHub for Project Management

**Git** is a software application for *distributed version control*. When you use Git to manage the files in a project, you're essentially taking snapshots of those files as you make changes to them. Doing this enables you to track back through the history of your changes, understand that history, and return to an earlier state of the project whenever necessary.

The *distributed* aspect of Git distinguishes it from many other version control systems. Git permits multiple users to maintain copies of a project on their own machines, work on the project files offline, then push their changes to a shared file repository in a way that avoids conflicts between different users' changes.

Finally, Git makes it easy to make someone else's project the starting point for your own. This workshop was [forked](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) from <https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum>, a workshop created by folks at the CUNY Graduate Center's [GC Digital Initiatives](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about/), where [Matthew K. Gold](https://github.com/mkgold) and [Lisa Marie Rhody](https://github.com/lmrhody) currently form the [leadership team](https://gcdi.commons.gc.cuny.edu/people/).

All these features of Git make it an attractive way to collaborate transparently on projects large and small.

This workshop will offer a high-level overview of Git and its related cloud-based service **GitHub**, emphasizing a few of the ways it can be useful to DH projects. Although Git's most powerful features are available only when it's used via the [command line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), we'll do our work today from Git's web interface, which works well for basic tasks and requires no previous set-up.

However, using GitHub's web interface does require an account. If you want to participate in the hands-on portion of this workshop but you haven't yet created an account on GitHub, you should do that now.
