# Sandbox

For today's workshop, we've created a sandbox repository where we can practice collaborating.

You'll want to fork this sandbox repository to your own account, too.

To do that, go to <https://github.com/milnegeneseo/nydh2019> and repeat the procedure you just followed in forking our workshop repository. Click "Fork," choose your own account as the destination, and you'll be back at your own account with two repositories.

You'll be inside `https://github.com/youraccountname/nydh2019` once you've done that. To see both your repositories, first click on your account name in the upper left of your window to get an overview of your account.

Then, click on the the Repositories link to see all your repositories.

Finally, go to your repository named `git`, click on the folder named `sections`, then click on the file named `sandbox`.
